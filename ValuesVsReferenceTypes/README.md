In JS we have two category types:
**Value Types(Primitives)**- They can be:  
-Number;  
-String;  
-Boolean;  
-Symbol;  
-undefined;  
-null;  
  
**Reference Types**- They can be:  
-Object;  
-Function; 
-Array;  
  
When we work with primitives the values are stored as variable. When we copy that variable that value that is stored in the variable is copied into the new variable- meaning that they are completely independent of each other  
  
  When we use reference type or object that object is not stored in the variable that it created it. When we modify an object using either variables that are pointing to the object the changes are immediatly visible to the other variables  

  - _Primitves_ are copied by their value;  
  - _Objects_ are copied by their reference
