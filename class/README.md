 Classes are a template for creating objects.
 the "new" keyword:
 - creates a new empty object {}  
 - sets the value of 'this' to the new empty object  
 - calls the constructor method  

The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an oject instance of that class.  
If constructor is not provided, then a default constructor will be supplied. If the class is base class, the default constructor is empty:
````
constructor() {}
````
