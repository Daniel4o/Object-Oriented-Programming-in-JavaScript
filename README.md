# Object-Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming(OOP) is programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
## Structure of OOP
- **-Classes** are a blueprint for creating objects(data structure), providing initil values for state(variables or attributes), and implementations of behaviour(functions or methods.)   
- **-Objects** are instances of a class with collection of keys(properties) which are used to hold values  
- **-Methods** are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviours of an object.
- **-Attributes** are defined in the class template and represent a value held by each object of the class. It represents some property of the thing that is shared by all the objects of that class. Each attribute has a value for each object

## 4 Pillars of Object-oriented Programming  

**-Encapsulation**: Is when we build variables and functions that work on that data within one unit, like _classes_. This concept is also used to hide the internal represantation, or state of an object from the outside- _information hiding_  
**-Abstraction**: Is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. Basically it goal is to 'show' essential   attributes and 'hide' unnecessary information-_information hiding_  
**-Inheritance**: Is a mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation-_extends_      
**-Polymorphism**: Is the act of redefining a method inside a derived child class of a parent- _overriding_
